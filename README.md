# Strip

**Effectively abandoned**

Most of the features of Stripe are not supported by any tf modules, and the API calls are not well understood to define our own modules at this stage.

The files in `./plans/*` are prepared for the repo once this has the time to learn Stripe APIs

The files in `./plans_old` utilize simple pricing values and not the newer UI focussed elements like pricing tables and customer portal that we rely on.
